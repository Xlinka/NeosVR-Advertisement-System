        <h2>Custom Tagging for SFW and NSFW Ads</h2>
        <p>The NeosVR Advertisement System provides a flexible tagging system that allows businesses and individuals to categorize their advertisements as either SFW or NSFW. This feature ensures that appropriate content is displayed to users based on their preferences and the context of the world they are in.</p>
        <p>In addition, the system respects user privacy and world settings. NSFW advertisements are only shown in hidden and private worlds, where the environment is explicitly set to allow such content. This approach maintains a safe and respectful environment while providing advertisers with targeted visibility in suitable contexts.</p>

        <h2>Review and Payment</h2>
        <p>Every submitted ad will undergo a thorough review process before going live on the advertisement system. Once confirmed, the ad will turn green and be displayed to the NeosVR community. Ads under review will appear as yellow in the management panel, while ads that have been denied will be shown in red.</p>
        <p>Please note that payment is taken before the review process due to the nature of cryptocurrency transactions. Ensure that your advertisement complies with both our guidelines and NeosVR guidelines to guarantee a smooth and appropriate advertising experience.</p>
